# SmartVision

SmartVision is a full-stack deep learning application that automates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system enables users to upload an image via a React-based web interface, processes it in a Flask backend, and returns the predicted label and confidence score in real time.

Built with TensorFlow, Flask, and React, this project demonstrates scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows for image data, real-time inference, and interactive visualization — aligning closely with real-world AI engineering and data pipeline development.
